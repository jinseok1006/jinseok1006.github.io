## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a main page that provides various services offered by **JEduTools**, built on **React**. By utilizing libraries based on the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, I implemented authentication features while carefully considering user-friendly design to deliver the best user experience. Additionally, I prepared countermeasures for various error situations that may arise during the development process, aiming for a stable service.

### Key Features
- **Service Integration**: Consolidated various services from JEduTools into a single main page to enhance accessibility.
- **OIDC Authentication Implementation**: Utilized libraries based on OpenID Connect to securely handle user authentication and authorization.
- **Responsive Design**: Thoughtfully considered design elements to provide an optimized UI/UX across different devices.

### Lessons Learned
- **Utilization of OIDC Libraries**: Gained a deeper understanding of the OIDC protocol and learned how to effectively leverage related libraries to implement authentication features.
- **Design Thinking**: Realized the importance of designing with user experience in mind and had the opportunity to experiment with various design patterns.
- **Improved Problem-Solving Skills**: Researched and applied solutions for various error situations encountered during development, enhancing my problem-solving capabilities.

### Challenges
- **Interactivity and Responsiveness**: Faced challenges in applying various state management techniques to enhance the responsiveness of the user interface.
- **Design Integration**: Needed to carefully consider how to create a UI that harmonizes with existing design guidelines, which required significant thought. This process taught me how to meet user demands while maintaining brand identity.
