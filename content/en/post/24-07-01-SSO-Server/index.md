## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Single Sign-On (SSO) server** based on **Keycloak**. The SSO server functions as an authentication server for campus software learning tools such as **JEduTools** and **JCloud**, allowing users to easily access various learning tools. Additionally, in-depth study of **OpenID Connect** has enhanced my understanding of authentication and authorization processes, and I learned how to leverage existing libraries to elevate the project.

### Key Features
- **Single Sign-On Functionality**: Enables users to access multiple applications with a single login.
- **OpenID Connect-based Authentication**: Provides secure and flexible authentication using a standardized protocol.
- **Utilization of Existing Libraries**: Integrates various open-source libraries to expand functionality and improve performance.

### Lessons Learned
- **Utilizing Keycloak**: Through the process of setting up the SSO server, I gained insights into the structure and operational principles of authentication systems.
- **Understanding OpenID Connect**: Learned how OpenID Connect operates and how to implement secure authentication using it.
- **Leveraging Existing Libraries**: Developed skills in applying and integrating various libraries to enhance the project.

### Challenges
- **Complex Configuration**: Encountered difficulties in managing numerous settings during the configuration of Keycloak and OpenID Connect.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Faced challenges in integrating with existing systems due to compatibility issues with various libraries. This experience helped improve my problem-solving skills.
