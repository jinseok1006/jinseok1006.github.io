## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a web page that provides **statistics on transfer and major change status** at Chonbuk National University. The user-friendly interface was developed using **React** and **Chakra UI**, allowing users to conveniently view statistical data. After collecting data from the university, the data was processed and refined using **Python** to provide accurate and useful insights.

### Key Features
- **Visualization of Transfer/Major Change Statistics**: The data is presented using intuitive visual elements for easy understanding.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Continuously collects and reflects the latest data from the university.
- **Mobile-friendly UI**: Chakra UI ensures an optimized user experience across different devices.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: For building dynamic UI components and managing data states.
- **Chakra UI**: To enhance responsiveness and usability in web design.
- **Python**: For data collection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.

### Lessons Learned
- **Integration of Frontend and Backend**: Learned design patterns to enable smooth communication between React (frontend) and Python (backend).
- **Importance of Data Visualization**: Gained experience in effectively visualizing complex data for better user comprehension.

### Challenges
- **Data Refinement**: Faced challenges in processing and refining raw data from the university.
- **Performance Optimization**: It was difficult to handle real-time data processing and deliver it quickly to users, requiring multiple optimization efforts.
